# **Thank You for Using Taboo AI!**

Dear Fantastic Taboo AI Players ðŸ§¡,

I hope this message finds you in high spirits and enjoying countless memorable moments with Taboo AI! Your enthusiasm and support have been the heart and soul of our web application, and we cannot thank you enough for being part of this incredible journey.

We have some important news to share with you. As a solo developer, I continuously strive to offer the best possible experience for the users. To ensure that I can maintain the highest level of service and continue delivering a top-notch gaming experience, I decided to make a slight adjustment to the features available in Taboo AI.

We will be bidding farewell to the **Daily Challenge** and **Leaderboard** features. I understand that these aspects have been cherished by many, but I believe that this change will allow me to channel more resources to focus on refining and enhancing other beloved aspects of Taboo AI.

But not to worry about playing Taboo AI â€“ The original "**Choose Topics**" remains at the heart of our game! You can still immerse yourself in the joy of wordplay by selecting from a wide range of captivating topics. And you can still submit your own unique topics via "**Contact Me**" section on the home page, and see them featured in the list of topics, and used by many around the world!

I also want to be transparent with you about the reason behind **the addition of ads to the game**. As a solo developer, providing the Taboo AI experience incurs costs, especially regarding the usage of ChatGPT services, which I deeply value for powering the AI-driven gameplay. Ads will serve as the sole source of revenue that enables me to sustain and continuously improve the game for you and all our players worldwide.

Rest assured, I have taken great care in implementing ads that are user-friendly and non-intrusive. You will find that they can be easily closed and will not block the main content, ensuring that your gaming experience remains as smooth and enjoyable as ever.

My commitment to providing a fun and educational platform for English language learners, word enthusiasts, and players from all walks of life remains strong. And I truly appreciate your understanding and support as I take this step towards creating an even more delightful gaming environment for you.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or simply want to share your thoughts, the "**Contact Me**" section is always open on the home page, waiting for your messages.

Thank you again for being part of the Taboo AI family. Together, let's keep the spirit of language exploration and friendly competition alive!
