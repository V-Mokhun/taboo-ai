Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to share with you this exciting news! Taboo AI has just gotten smarter when **providing evaluation to your clues** in the Results Page. After you finish a game, you will be directed to the Results Page where the AI will perform a round of assessment on the quality of your clues. To better facilitate English learners, I have boost the performance of AI judge to **not only providing you a score with its reasoning, but also providing you feedbacks on how you can improve on your clues**.

For example, if you are using incorrect grammar or sentence structure, the AI will notify you and provide a suggested example for you to follow and learn from the mistakes!
